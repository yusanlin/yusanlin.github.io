{"name":"Research","tagline":"","body":"## Research\r\nMy research interests lie in the fields of Information Retrieval, Data Mining, Pattern Recognition and Natural Language Processing. I have combined my knowledge in these fields with my outside interests to form my current research topics. In particular, I'm working with Dr. Heng Xu and Dr. Yilu Zhou on a series of \"Fashionology\" papers, where we aim to reveal interesting facts from historical fashion data.\r\n\r\n### Professional Talks\r\n- *Fashionology: A Textual Analysis Approach of Understanding Innovativeness and Influence of Fashion Trends*, [INFORMS 2014 Marketing Science Conference](http://staging.goizueta.emory.edu/marketingscience2014/), June, 2014\r\n\r\n- *Fashionology: A Textual Analysis Approach of Understanding the Fashion Industry*, Penn State University Graduate Exhibition, April, 2014 [poster](http://www.yusanlin.com/files/posters/fashionology_graduate_exhibition_poster_finalized.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Current Projects\r\n- Fashion inspiration tracing (with Xu, H. and Zhou, Y.)\r\n- Fashion trend evolution pattern finding (with Xu, H. and Zhou, Y.)\r\n- Fashion trend prediction (with Xu, H. and Zhou, Y.)\r\n\r\n### Fashion Taxonomy\r\nIn the process of conducting research, we built a fashion taxonomy. It is a collection of over 2000 fashion-related terms separated into 16 categories. If you're interested in fashion research with text data, this will be a helpful tool for your project. We aim to release it in the first half of 2014.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
